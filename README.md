# zola-theme-cyber-walk
Cyber Walk is a high-fidelity, cyberpunk-engineered theme interface for Zola. Cyber Walk is a digital workspace designed for technical architects, backend engineers, and systems administrators who communicate through code. It abandons modern minimalism for the raw, high-contrast aesthetics of a terminal boot sequence.
